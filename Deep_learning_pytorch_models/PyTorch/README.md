# Deep Learning with PyTorch

* **Part 1:** Introduction to PyTorch and using tensors
* **Part 2:** Building fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch
* **Part 3:** How to train a fully-connected network with backpropagation on MNIST
* **Part 4:** Exercise - train a neural network on Fashion-MNIST
* **Part 5:** Using a trained network for making predictions and validating networks
* (Optional) **Part 6:** How to save and load trained models
* (Week 2-3)**Part 7:** Load image data with torchvision, also data augmentation
* (Week 2-3) **Part 8:** Use transfer learning to train a state-of-the-art image classifier for dogs and cats

Note:
1. All exercises uses Image Data but None of them uses CNN. Image data is converted into numerical data and then used in a Fully Connected Neural Network.(Skip Part 7 and 8 for now though they do not require CNNs).
