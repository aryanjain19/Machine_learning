### Machine Learning
I completed the Machine learning course by Andrew Ng (Stanford) through Coursera. 

The certificate I received can be found **[here](https://coursera.org/share/5e6e24c6f4a867f51b5d31c82c63c0bc)**

The **handwritten number recognition** dir contains a model which identifies the handwritten numbers.  

The **exercise**  repo contains the assignments of that course
The Course included- 
  1. Linear regression
  2. Classification
  3. Neural networks 
  4. Superwised learning
  5. Unsuperwised learning
